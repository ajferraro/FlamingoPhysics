# FlamingoPhysics

Inspired by the work of [@gazbd](https://twitter.com/gazbd) and [@Rosalindphys](https://twitter.com/Rosalindphys) I can see there are many advantages to producing new physics resources. However I think there is huge value in opening this up for all physics teachers to contribute to.

## Principles

* Working collaboratively will increase the speed resources are made.
* Working collaboratively will increase the quality of resources.
* We're not trying to create exam questions, these should be repeatable tasks for student to practice.
* Contibute all variations back for the community to benefit.

## Limitations

* I'm a self-taught amateur developer! My code is not clean or efficient, but sometimes gets the job done. Comments for improvements are welcome.

## Future goals

- [ ] Consistent design across all resources. Latex template?
- [ ] Complete all areas of the GCSE
- [ ] Complate all areas of the A-Level
- [ ] Build a community of contributors both authoring and using Github issues
- [ ] Expand beyond worksheets to textbook pages

## Why FlamingoPhysics?

Why not? Alliteration is fun.
