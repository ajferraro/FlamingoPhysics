## Contributing

Firstly, thank you for considering contributing to this project. Only though the addition of more and more teachers will the project grow.

At the moment, this is just a collection of resources that I make but hopefully this can grow.

## General rules

* Use rmarkdown where possible. It's open, free, allows for multiple langagues and is well documented.
* Resources should be exam board agnositic. Exam board specific requirements can be included if they do not contradict other boards.
* Code, where used, should be commented as comprehensively as possible to help others.
* Answers should be included for each activity.
* Contibute all variations back for the community to benefit.
* Authors can identify themselves in code but not on the worksheets themselves.
